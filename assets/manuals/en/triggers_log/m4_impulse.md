Impulse is a metric that shows how strong your urge to postpone quitting is after you've met a trigger, described the situation, and thought of a solution. Impulse tends to melt down quickly when treated correctly, but it has an accumulation effect, and if the counterthought isn't in the bullseye, the impulse will only grow. This is normal. Only after a long work on yourself can you live with the impulse and defeat the addiction. That is not to accumulate impulses at all and to ignore the triggers.
