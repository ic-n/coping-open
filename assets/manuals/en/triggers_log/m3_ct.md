A counterthought is a thought you want to have the next time you encounter that trigger. No one but you know why you decided to quit, so try to find them and expand them to fit the specific trigger. Referring to the coffee situation, for example, suppose the reason for quitting smoking was dental health; the counter-thought could be a reminder of the effect of cigarettes and coffee on the color of your teeth.
